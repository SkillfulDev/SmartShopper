# Smart Shopper and Notepad App

This project is focused on creating a comprehensive application that combines both a "Shopping List" and a "Notepad" in a single app. The goal is to explore and master the use of the Room Persistence Library for handling SQLite databases effectively. Alongside learning database management, this project will also cover a wide range of Android development topics to build a fully functional and polished app.

## Features

- **Database Management with Room**: Learn how to set up and work with Room Persistence Library to manage SQLite databases, including creating and managing tables, and establishing relationships between them.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Understand and implement the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern to build a maintainable and testable codebase.
- **In-App Purchases and Ads**: Integrate advertisements and in-app purchases to monetize the application.
- **Preference Screen**: Create a settings screen using Preference Screen to allow users to customize the app experience.
- **Customizable Themes**: Implement functionality to change the app's theme based on user preferences.
- **User Interface Design**: Design and develop layouts for various screens, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
- **Fragments and Navigation**: Utilize Fragments for creating dynamic UI components and managing navigation within the app.
- **AlertDialogs**: Implement AlertDialogs for user input and notifications.
- **RecyclerView and Adapters**: Gain in-depth knowledge of working with RecyclerView and RecyclerView Adapters, including using different layouts within a single adapter.
- **LiveData**: Learn to use LiveData to manage and observe data changes efficiently within the app.

## Learning Objectives

This project provides a thorough understanding of building an Android application from scratch, including:
